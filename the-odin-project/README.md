# The Odin Project - My Learning Journey
This repository is a collection of projects I completed while following The Odin Project's web development curriculum. It serves as a record of my progress and showcases the skills I've acquired throughout the course.

## Project Structure

The projects are organized into folders reflecting the curriculum's structure:

 1. **[foundations](https://its-jaspreet.github.io/fortpolio/the-odin-project/foundations):** Contains projects from the Foundations section of the course.

 2. **[full-stack-javascript](https://github.com/its-jaspreet/fortpolio/tree/main/the-odin-project/full-stack-javascript):** Contains projects from the Full Stack JavaScript path
	* **intermediate-html-css:** Sub-folder for projects from the intermediate HTML and CSS section of the course.
	* **[javascript](https://github.com/its-jaspreet/fortpolio/tree/main/the-odin-project/full-stack-javascript/javascript):** Sub-folder for projects from the JavaScript section of the course.

Each project will have its own sub-folder with relevant files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
