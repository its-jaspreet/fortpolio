**About Me**
Hi! I am Jaspreet! I am a final year student from India pursuing my B. Tech CSE, with a specialization in blockchain technology and a minors in machine learning. My ultimate goal is to become a blockchain developer (a DApp developer to be precise) and a full-stack developer one day. 

I believe in learning by doing. As the saying goes, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy," or in this case, all tutorial videos and documentation and not enough practice makes a dull coder. That's why I created "*fortpolio*", wherein I showcase the code I've built while learning web development and track my progress. This is my portfolio of sorts (Well, not the actual one, but that is a making in progress too)!

## Fortpolio Folder Structure

My fortpolio is broadly organized into folders on the basis of the source of my learning or the project type. Here's a breakdown of the folders in this repository:

-   **[frontendmentor.io-projects]()** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This folder contains projects completed on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), a platform that provides challenges to practice one's front-end development skills.
    
-   **learning-by-practice** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This folder holds snippets of code I wrote for practicing the concepts I learned whilst watching tutorials.
    
-   **[the-odin-project](https://its-jaspreet.github.io/fortpolio/the-odin-project/)** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This directory includes projects built while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, a free web development course.
    
-   **[freeCodeCamp-JS-Algos-Data-Structures](https://its-jaspreet.github.io/fortpolio/freeCodeCamp-JS-Algos-Data-Structures/)** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This folder is a work in progress and contains some projects related to the [freeCodeCamp certification track for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/).
    
-   **[youtube-clone]()** (HTML, CSS)
This project is a responsive web design clone of YouTube, focusing on styling with HTML and CSS.
